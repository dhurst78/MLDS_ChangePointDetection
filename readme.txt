All code is written in R.
In order for the code to run the following packages will need to be installed:
smotefamily, caret, data.table, lubridate, pROC, yfR, h2o, ggplot2, cowplot

this can be done by running the line below:
install.packages('smotefamily','caret','data.table','lubridate','pROC','yfR','h2o','ggplot2','cowplot')


The codes require a 'helper' file ('00_function.R'), which all files 'source'.
This file contains useful functions and some global parameters.

With the exception of this helper file, each code script has two directory paths which will need to be altered before running.
The input directory (inDIR) should refer to the location of the helper file '00_function.R' on your local machine.
The output directory (outDIR) can be set to anything. It is the location where the images generated by the code will be saved.

The files are designed to be run one at a time, and are generally labelled in order of where the files outputs appear in the final MSc thesis.
